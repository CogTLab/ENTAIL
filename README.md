# Explainability in Non-pharmacological Treatment for cognitive Aging and dementia related analytIcal methods and software Library (ENTAIL)

<b>Objective:</b> Guide inductive data analysis, interpretation, and comparison of intervention effect within and between Numerous non-pharmacological treatments (NPTs) among end-users. ENTAIL will contain computational models (implemented in R and Python), example datasets, and demonstration of analysis and interpretation for specific functions of explainability for dementia-related NPT, and serve to enhance explainability of NPTs, guided by our Explainability framework in [1].

<b>Aims:</b>
<li>Promote the translation of advanced computational analytical methods to the examination of explainability in existing dementia-related NPT datasets. </li> 
<li>Promote the utilization of the ENTAIL among end-users (e.g., interventionists in dementia and brain aging research)</li>
